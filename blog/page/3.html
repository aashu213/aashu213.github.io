It didn’t work reliably for function components, often failed to update the screen, and wasn’t resilient to typos and mistakes. We heard that most people turned it off because it was too unreliable.</p><p>In React Native 0.61, <strong>we’re unifying the existing “live reloading” (reload on save) and “hot reloading” features into a single new feature called “Fast Refresh”</strong>. Fast Refresh was implemented from scratch with the following principles:</p><ul><li>Fast Refresh <strong>fully supports modern React</strong>, including function components and Hooks.</li><li>Fast Refresh <strong>gracefully recovers after typos</strong> and other mistakes, and falls back to a full reload when needed.</li><li>Fast Refresh <strong>doesn’t perform invasive code transformations</strong> so it’s reliable enough to be on by default.</li></ul><p>To see Fast Refresh in action, check out this video:</p><p style="text-align:center"><video width="700" controls="" autoplay=""><source type="video/mp4" src="https://reactnative.dev/img/homepage/ReactRefresh.mp4"></video></p><p>Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you prefer, you can turn it off in the Dev Menu (Cmd+D on iOS, Cmd+M or Ctrl+M on Android). Turning it on and off is instant so you can do it any time.</p><p>Here are a few Fast Refresh tips:</p><ul><li>Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks!) by default.</li><li>If you need to reset the React state on every edit, you can add a special <code>// @refresh reset</code> comment to the file with that component.</li><li>Fast Refresh always remounts class components without preserving state. This ensures it works reliably.</li><li>We all make mistakes in the code! Fast Refresh automatically retries rendering after you save a file. You don&#x27;t need to reload the app manually after fixing a syntax or a runtime error.</li><li>Adding a <code>console.log</code> or a <code>debugger</code> statement during edits is a neat debugging technique.</li></ul><p>Please report any issues with Fast Refresh on GitHub, and we’ll look into them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="other-improvements">Other Improvements<a class="hash-link" href="#other-improvements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Fixed use_frameworks! CocoaPods support.</strong> In 0.60 we made some updates to integrate CocoaPods by default. Unfortunately, this broke builds using <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use_frameworks!</a>. This is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/25619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed in 0.61</a>, making it easier to integrate React Native into your iOS projects that require building with dynamic frameworks.</li><li><strong>Add useWindowDimensions Hook.</strong> This new Hook automatically provides and subscribes to dimension updates, and can be used instead of the Dimensions API in most cases.</li><li><strong>React was upgraded to 16.9.</strong> This version deprecates old names for the UNSAFE<!-- -->_<!-- --> lifecycle methods, contains improvements to <code>act</code>, and more. See the <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/08/react-v16.9.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React 16.9 blog post</a> for an automated migration script and more information.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes<a class="hash-link" href="#breaking-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Remove React .xcodeproj.</strong> In 0.60, we introduced auto-linking support via CocoaPods. We have also integrated CocoaPods into the e2e tests runs, so that from now on, we have a unified standard way of integrating RN into iOS apps. This effectively deprecates the React .xcodeproj support, and the file has been removed starting 0.61. Note: if you use 0.60 auto-linking already, you shouldn&#x27;t be affected.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="thanks">Thanks<a class="hash-link" href="#thanks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to all of the contributors that helped make 0.61 possible!</p><p>To see all the updates, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.61 changelog</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_1YZR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_3GNh"><a class="tag__u1m tagRegular_Kusr" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li><li class="tag_3GNh"><a class="tag__u1m tagRegular_Kusr" href="/blog/tags/release">release</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_28zC" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2019/07/17/hermes">Meet Hermes, a new JavaScript Engine optimized for React Native</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_2ipU margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-07-17T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 17, 2019</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_3dH_"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/rachelnabors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_2B_A" src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236306?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Rachel Nabors"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/rachelnabors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rachel Nabors</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Documentation Engineer at Facebook</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last week at Chain React we announced Hermes, an open source JavaScript engine we’ve been working on at Facebook.

With this data in hand, we knew we had to optimize JavaScript performance in the more constrained environments of a mobile phone compared with a desktop or laptop.

For 0.60, React Native has been migrated over to AndroidX. This is a breaking change, and <strong>your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated</strong> as well.</p><blockquote><p>With this change, React Native apps will need to begin using AndroidX themselves.

This screen is what most people see when they are first using React Native. It now links first time users to the documentation and the look fits with our upcoming website redesign 🌟.

In just over two weeks, the community sent ~40 Pull Requests to complete this work for flow typed native modules. Aside from the people already mentioned above, we’d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/michalchudziak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Chudziak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thymikee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Pierzchała</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wojteg1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wojtek Szafraniec</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jeanregisser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean Regisser</a> and everyone else who sent one or more Pull Requests.</li><li><strong>Haste:</strong> Since 2015 React Native used the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“haste” module system</a> that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/JI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Ide</a> proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">umbrella task</a> and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen! Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/JI/status/1136369775083319296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his Twitter thread</a> to learn more.</li><li><strong>Android Fragments:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/jpshelley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Shelley</a>‘s proposal to make React Native work via <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Fragments</a> was merged and will be available in 0.61. <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more about Android Fragments here</a>.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="lean-core">Lean Core<a class="hash-link" href="#lean-core" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The primary motivation of <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core</a> has been to split modules out of React Native into separate repositories so they can receive better maintenance. In just a six months repositories like <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetInfo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsyncStorage</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI</a> received more than 800 Pull Requests combined. Besides better maintenance, these projects can also be independently released more often than React Native itself.</p><p>We have also taken the opportunity to remove obsolete polyfills and legacy components from React Native itself. Polyfills were necessary in the past to support language features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Set</code></a> in older versions of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Now that React Native ships with a new version, these polyfills were removed.</p><p>This work is still in progress and many more things still need to be split out or removed both on the native and JavaScript side but there are early signs that we managed to reverse the trend of increasing the surface area and app size: When looking at the JavaScript bundle for example, about a year ago in version 0.54 the React Native JavaScript bundle size was 530kb and grew to 607kb (+77kb) by version 0.57 in just 6 months. Now we are seeing a bundle size reduction of 28kb down to 579kb on master, a delta of more than 100kb!</p><p>As we conclude the first iteration of the Lean Core effort, we will make an effort to be more intentional about new APIs added to React Native and we will continuously evaluate ways to make React Native smaller and faster, as well as finding ways to empower the community to take ownership of various components.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="user-feedback">User Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#user-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Six months ago we asked the community “<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do you dislike about React Native?</a>” which gave a good overview of problems people are facing. We <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to the post a few months ago</a> and it&#x27;s time to summarize the progress that was made on top issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Upgrading:</strong> The React Native community rallied around with multiple improvements to the upgrading experience: <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autolinking</a>, a better upgrading command via <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a>, an upgrade helper website (coming soon). We’ll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.</li><li><strong>Support / Uncertainty:</strong> Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook&#x27;s investment in React Native. As we&#x27;ve shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable <a href="/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires">inline-requires</a> by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.</li><li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We recently started an effort to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul and rewrite all of React Native&#x27;s documentation</a>. If you are looking to contribute, we’d love to get your help!</li><li><strong>Warnings in Xcode:</strong> We <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got rid of all the existing warnings</a> and are making an effort not to introduce new warnings.</li><li><strong>Hot Reloading:</strong> The React team is building a <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1126948870137753605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new hot reloading system</a> that will soon be integrated into React Native.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately we weren’t able to improve everything just yet:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging:</strong> We fixed many inconvenient bugs and issues people that we have been running into every day, but unfortunately we haven&#x27;t made as much progress on this as we would like. We recognize that debugging with React Native isn&#x27;t great and we&#x27;ll prioritize improving this in the future.</li><li><strong>Metro symlinks:</strong> Unfortunately we haven&#x27;t been able to implement a simple and straightforward solution for this yet. However, React Native users <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared various workarounds</a> that may work for you.</li></ul><p>Given the large amount of changes in the past six months, we&#x27;d like to ask you the same question again.

Facebook’s infrastructure is different from common continuous integration services and not all open source tests were run inside of Facebook. This means that commits that sync out to GitHub frequently break tests in open source which take a lot of time to fix.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hectorramos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Héctor Ramos</a> from the React Native team spent the past two months improving React Native&#x27;s continuous integration systems both at Facebook and on GitHub. Most of the open source tests are now run before changes are committed to React Native at Facebook which will keep CI stable on GitHub when commits are being synchronized.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="next">Next<a class="hash-link" href="#next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Make sure to check out our talks about the future of React Native!

JSC on Android was a few years old, which meant that a lot of modern JavaScript features weren&#x27;t supported. Even worse, it performed poorly compared iOS&#x27;s modern JSC. With this release, that all changes.</p><p>Thanks to some awesome work by <a href="https://github.com/danielzlotin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DanielZlotin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dulmandakh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dulmandakh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gengjiawen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gengjiawen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kmagiera</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kudo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kudo</a> JSC has caught up with the past few years.

Applications load resources as needed rather than slowing down launch. This feature is called &quot;inline requires&quot;, as it lets Metro identify components to be lazy loaded. Apps with a deep and varied component architecture will see the most improvement.</p><p><img alt="source of the `metro.config.js` file in the 0.59 template, demonstrating where to enable `inlineRequires`" src="/assets/images/inline-requires-3cb1be96938288642a666bdf3dca62b5.png"></p><p>We need the community to let us know how it works before we turn it on by default.

Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project&#x27;s surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management.</p><p>In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. Read on for more details:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="pull-requests">Pull Requests<a class="hash-link" href="#pull-requests" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In order to build a healthy community, we must respond quickly to code contributions. In past years, we de-prioritized reviewing community contributions and accumulated 280 pull requests (December 2018). In the first milestone, we reduced the number of open pull requests to ~65. Simultaneously, the average number of pull requests opened per day increased from 3.5 to 7 which means we have handled about <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">600 pull requests</a> in the last three months.</p><p>We merged <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost two-thirds</a> and closed one-third of the pull requests. They were closed without being merged if they are obsolete or low quality, or if they unnecessarily increase the project&#x27;s surface area. Most of the merged pull requests fixed bugs, improved cross-platform parity, or introduced new features. Notable contributions include improving type safety and the ongoing work to support AndroidX.</p><p>At Facebook, we run React Native from master, so we test all changes first before they make it into a React Native Release. Out of all the merged pull requests, only six caused issues: four only affected internal development and two were caught in the release candidate state.</p><p>One of the more visible community contributions was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated “RedBox” screen</a>. It&#x27;s a good example of how the community is making the developer experience friendlier.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="lean-core">Lean Core<a class="hash-link" href="#lean-core" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>React Native currently has a very wide surface area with many unmaintained abstractions that we do not use a lot at Facebook. We are working on reducing the surface area in order to make React Native smaller and allow the community to take better care of abstractions that are mostly unused at Facebook.</p><p>In the first milestone, <a href="https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1093171521114247171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we asked the community for help on the Lean Core project</a>. The response was overwhelming and we could barely keep up with all the progress. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out all the work completed in less than a month</a>!</p><p>What we are most excited about is that maintainers have jumped in fixing long standing issues, adding tests, and supporting long requested features. These modules are getting more support than they ever did within React Native, showing that this is a great step for the community. Examples of such projects are <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a> that has <a href="https://twitter.com/titozzz/status/1101283928026034176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received many pull requests</a> since their extraction and the CLI that is now <a href="https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintained by members of the community</a> and received much needed improvements and fixes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="leading-user-problems">Leading User Problems<a class="hash-link" href="#leading-user-problems" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In December, we asked the community what they <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disliked about React Native</a>. We aggregated the responses and <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to each and every problem</a>. Fortunately, many of the issues that our community faces are also problems at Facebook. In our next milestone, we plan to address some of the main problems.</p><p>One of the highest voted problems was the developer experience of upgrading to newer versions of React Native. Unfortunately, this is not something that we experience ourselves because we run React Native from master. Thankfully, members from the community already stepped up to address this problem:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/thymikee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Pierzchała</a> from Callstack <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli/pull/176/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved react-native upgrade</a> by using <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a> under the hood. We also updated the website to remove outdated upgrade instructions.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We plan on recommending CocoaPods by default for iOS projects</a> which will reduce churn in project files when upgrading React Native. This will make it easier for people to install and link third-party modules which is even more important in the context of Lean Core as we expect projects to link more modules by default.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="059-release">0.59 Release<a class="hash-link" href="#059-release" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Without the help of the React Native community, especially <a href="https://github.com/grabbou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Grabowski</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kelset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorenzo Sciandra</a>, we would not be able to ship releases. We want to improve the release management process and plan to be more involved from now on:</p><ul><li>We will work with community members to create a blog post for each major release.</li><li>We will show breaking changes directly in the CLI when people upgrade to new versions.</li><li>We will reduce the time it takes to make a release. We are exploring ways to increase automated testing and also creating an improved manual test plan.</li></ul><p>Many of these plans will be incorporated in the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.59.0-rc.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native 0.59 release</a>. 0.59 will ship with React Hooks, a new 64-bit version of JavaScriptCore for Android, and many performance and functionality improvements. It is currently published as a release candidate and is expected to be stable within the next two weeks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="next-steps">Next Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#next-steps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For the next two months, we will continue managing pull requests <a href="https://k03lwm00zo.codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to stay on track</a> while also starting to reduce the number of outstanding GitHub issues. We will continue reducing the surface area of React Native through the Lean Core project. We plan to address 5 of the top community problems. As we finalize the community guidelines, we will turn attention to our website and documentation.</p><p>We are very excited to host over ten contributors from our community at Facebook London in March to help drive several of these efforts. We are glad that you are using React Native and hope that you&#x27;ll see and feel the improvements we are working on in 2019.

We believe that a few years from now we will look back and see that this shift was a turning point for React Native.</p><p>A lot of people are excited about the rewrite of React Native&#x27;s architecture, widely known as <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabric</a>. Among other things, this will fix fundamental limitations in React Native&#x27;s architecture and will set up React Native for success in the future together with <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSI and TurboModules</a>.</p><p>The biggest shift in 2018 was to empower the React Native Community. From the beginning, Facebook encouraged developers from all around the world to participate in React Native&#x27;s open source project. Since then, a number of core contributors emerged to handle, among other things, the release process.</p><p>These members took a few substantial steps towards making the whole community more empowered to shape the future of this project with the following resources:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="react-native-releases-"><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-releases</code></a> 📬<a class="hash-link" href="#react-native-releases-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This repository, created in January, serves the dual purpose of allowing everyone to keep up the new releases in a more collaborative manner and opened the conversation of what would be part of a certain release to whomever wanted to suggest a cherry-pick (like for <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.57.8</a> and all its previous versions).</p><p>This has been the driving force behind moving away from a monthly release cycle, and the &quot;long term support&quot; approach currently used for version 0.57.x.</p><p>Half of the credit for reaching these decisions goes to the other repository created this year:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="discussions-and-proposals-"><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>discussions-and-proposals</code></a> 🗣<a class="hash-link" href="#discussions-and-proposals-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This repository, created in July, expanded on the idea of a more open environment for conversations on React Native. Previously, this need was handled by issues labelled <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/For%20Discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>For Discussion</code></a> in the main repository, but we wanted to expand this strategy to an RFC approach that other libraries have (e.g. React).</p><p>This experiment immediately found its role in the React Native lifecycle. The Facebook team is now using the community RFC process to discuss what could <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be improved in React Native</a>, and coordinate the efforts around the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core project</a> - among other interesting discussions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="reactnativecomm-"><a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a> 🐣<a class="hash-link" href="#reactnativecomm-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We are aware that our approach to communicate these efforts has not been as effective as we would have liked, and in an attempt to give you all an easier time keeping up with everything going on in the React Native Community (from releases to active discussions) we created a new twitter account that you can rely on <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a>.</p><p>If you are not on that social network, remember that you can always watch repositories via GitHub; this feature improved these past few months with the possibility of being notified only for releases, so you should consider using it anyway.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="what-awaits-ahead-">What awaits ahead 🎓<a class="hash-link" href="#what-awaits-ahead-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Over the past 7-8 months, core contributors enhanced the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Community GitHub organization</a> to take more ownership over the development of React Native, and enhance collaboration with Facebook. But this always lacked the formal structure that similar projects may have in place.</p><p>This organization can set the example for everyone in the larger developer community by enforcing a set of standards for all the packages/repos hosted in it, providing a single place for maintainers to help each other and contribute quality code that conforms to community-agreed standards.</p><p>In early 2019, we will have this new set of guidelines in place. Let us know what you think in the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated discussion</a>.</p><p>We are confident that with these changes, the community will become more collaborative so that when we reach 1.0, we will all continue to write (even more) awesome apps by leveraging this joint effort 🤗</p><hr><p>I hope you are as excited as we are about the future of this community. We&#x27;re excited to see all of you involved either in the conversations happening in the repositories listed above or via the awesome code you’ll produce.</p><p>Happy coding!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_1YZR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_3GNh"><a class="tag__u1m tagRegular_Kusr" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_28zC" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2018/11/01/oss-roadmap">Open Source Roadmap</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_2ipU margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2018-11-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 1, 2018</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_3dH_"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://hectorramos.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_2B_A" src="https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/f2223874e66e884c99087e452501f2da?s=128" alt="Héctor Ramos"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://hectorramos.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Héctor Ramos</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Engineer at Facebook</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="/assets/images/oss-roadmap-hero-3e488e41aaa6ecb2107c16608d5d9392.jpg"></p><p>This year, the React Native team has focused on a large scale <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-architecture of React Native</a>. As Sophie mentioned in her <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018">State of React Native post,</a> we&#x27;ve sketched out a plan to better support the thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside of Facebook. It&#x27;s now time to share more details about what we&#x27;ve been working on. Before I do so, I&#x27;d like to lay out our long-term vision for React Native in open source.</p><p>Our vision for React Native is...</p><ul><li><strong>A healthy GitHub repository.</strong> Issues and pull requests get handled within a reasonable period of time.<ul><li>Increased test coverage.</li><li>Commits that sync out from the Facebook code repository should not break open source tests.</li><li>A higher scale of meaningful community contributions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stable APIs,</strong> making it easier to interface with open source dependencies.<ul><li>Facebook uses the same public API as open source</li><li>React Native releases that follow semantic versioning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A vibrant eco-system.</strong> High quality ViewManagers, native modules, and multiple platform support maintained by the community.</li><li><strong>Excellent documentation.</strong> Focus on helping users create high quality experiences, and up-to-date API reference docs.</li></ul><p>We have identified the following focus areas to help us achieve this vision.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="️-lean-core">✂️ Lean Core<a class="hash-link" href="#️-lean-core" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Our goal is to <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce the surface area of React Native</a> by removing non-core and unused components. We&#x27;ll transfer non-core components to the community to allow it to move faster. The reduced surface area will make it easier to manage contributions to React Native.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0001-webview.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>WebView</code></a> is an example of a component that we transferred to the community. We are working on a workflow that will allow internal teams to continue using these components after we remove them from the repository. We have identified <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dozens more components</a> that we&#x27;ll give ownership of to the community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="-open-sourcing-internals-and-updated-tooling">🎁 Open Sourcing Internals and 🛠Updated Tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#-open-sourcing-internals-and-updated-tooling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The React Native development experience for product teams at Facebook can be quite different from open source. Tools that may be popular in the open source community are not used at Facebook. There may be an internal tool that achieves the same purpose. In some cases, Facebook teams have become used to tools that do not exist outside of Facebook. These disparities can pose challenges when we open source our upcoming architecture work.</p><p>We&#x27;ll work on releasing some of these internal tools. We&#x27;ll also improve support for tools popular with the open source community. Here&#x27;s a non-exhaustive list of projects we&#x27;ll tackle:</p><ul><li>Open source JSI and enable the community to bring their own JavaScript VMs, replacing the existing JavaScriptCore from RN&#x27;s initial release. We&#x27;ll be covering what JSI is in a future post, in the meantime you can learn more about JSI from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parashuram&#x27;s talk at React Conf</a>.</li><li>Support 64-bit libraries on Android.</li><li>Enable debugging under the new architecture.</li><li>Improve support for CocoaPods, Gradle, Maven, and new Xcode build system.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="-testing-infrastructure">✅ Testing Infrastructure<a class="hash-link" href="#-testing-infrastructure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When Facebook engineers publish code, it&#x27;s considered safe to land if it passes all tests. These tests identify whether a change might break one of our own React Native surfaces. Yet, there are differences in how Facebook uses React Native. This has allowed us to unknowingly break React Native in open source.</p><p>We&#x27;ll shore up our internal tests to ensure they run in an environment that is as close as possible to open source. This will help prevent code that breaks these tests from making it to open source. We will also work on infrastructure to enable better testing of the core repo on GitHub, enabling future pull requests to easily include tests.</p><p>Combined with the reduced surface area, this will allow contributors to merge pull requests quicker, with confidence.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="-public-api">📜 Public API<a class="hash-link" href="#-public-api" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Facebook will consume React Native via the public API, the same way open source does, to reduce unintentional breaking changes. We have started converting internal call sites to address this. Our goal is to converge on a stable, public API, leading to the adoption of semantic versioning in version 1.0.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="-communication">📣 Communication<a class="hash-link" href="#-communication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>React Native is one of the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-and-trending-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top open source projects on GitHub</a> by contributor count. That makes us really happy, and we&#x27;d like to keep it going. We&#x27;ll continue working on initiatives that lead to involved contributors, such as increased transparency and open discussion. The documentation is one of the first things someone new to React Native will encounter, yet it has not been a priority. We&#x27;d like to fix that, starting with bringing back auto-generated API reference docs, creating additional content focused on creating <a href="/docs/improvingux">quality user experiences</a>, and improving our <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="timeline">Timeline<a class="hash-link" href="#timeline" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We&#x27;re planning to land these projects throughout the next year or so. Some of these efforts are already ongoing, such as <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/e337bcafb0b017311c37f2dbc24e5a757af0a205...8427f64e06456f171f9df0316c6ca40613de7a20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSI which has already landed in open source</a>. Others will take a bit longer to complete, such as reducing the surface area. We&#x27;ll do our best to keep the community up to date with our progress. Please join us in the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussions and Proposals</a> repository, a initiative from the React Native community that has led to the creation of several of the initiatives discussed in this roadmap.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_1YZR padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_3GNh"><a class="tag__u1m tagRegular_Kusr" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_28zC" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2018/08/27/wkwebview">Introducing new iOS WebViews</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_2ipU margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2018-08-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 27, 2018</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_3dH_"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/rsnara" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ramanpreet Nara</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Software Engineer at Facebook</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For a long time now, Apple has discouraged using UIWebViews in favor of WKWebView. In iOS 12, which will be released in the upcoming months, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/234/?time=104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIWebViews will be formally deprecated</a>. React Native&#x27;s iOS WebView implementation relies heavily on the UIWebView class. Therefore, in light of these developments, we&#x27;ve built a new native iOS backend to the WebView React Native component that uses WKWebView.</p><p>The tail end of these changes were landed in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/33b353c97c31190439a22febbd3d2a9ead49d3c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this commit</a>, and will become available in the 0.57 release.</p><p>To opt into this new implementation, please use the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.63/webview#usewebkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useWebKit</code></a> prop:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_1ukp language-js theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_3Y8q js"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-js codeBlock_2Xgr thin-scrollbar" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><code class="codeBlockLines_3Zfi"><span class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">&lt;</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">WebView</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain">  useWebKit</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">=</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token boolean" style="color:#ff8b50">true</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain">  source</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">=</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token plain"> url</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#8dc891">&#x27;https://www.google.com&#x27;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">/</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_1mju clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="improvements">Improvements<a class="hash-link" href="#improvements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><code>UIWebView</code> had no legitimate way to facilitate communication between the JavaScript running in the WebView, and React Native. When messages were sent from the WebView, we relied on a hack to deliver them to React Native. Succinctly, we encoded the message data into a url with a special scheme, and navigated the WebView to it. On the native side, we intercepted and cancelled this navigation, parsed the data from the url, and finally called into React Native. This implementation was error prone and insecure. I&#x27;m glad to announce that we&#x27;ve leveraged <code>WKWebView</code> features to completely replace it.</p><p>Other benefits of WKWebView over UIWebView include faster JavaScript execution, and a multi-process architecture. Please see this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 WWDC</a> for more details.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_23Bc" id="caveats">Caveats<a class="hash-link" href="#caveats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If your components use the following props, then you may experience problems when switching to WKWebView. For the time being, we suggest that you avoid using these props:</p><p><strong>Inconsistent behavior:</strong></p><p><code>automaticallyAdjustContentInsets</code> and <code>contentInsets</code> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bacfd9297657569006bab2b1f024ad1f289b1b27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commit</a>)</p><p>When you add contentInsets to a <code>WKWebView</code>, it doesn&#x27;t change the <code>WKWebView</code>&#x27;s viewport. The viewport remains the same size as the frame. With <code>UIWebView</code>, the viewport size actually changes (gets smaller, if the content insets are positive).</p><p><code>backgroundColor</code> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/215fa14efc2a817c7e038075163491c8d21526fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commit</a>)</p><p>With the new iOS implementation of WebView, there&#x27;s a chance that your background color will flicker into view if you use this property. Furthermore, <code>WKWebView</code> renders transparent backgrounds differently from <code>UIWebview</code>. Please look at the commit description for more details.</p><p><strong>Not supported:</strong></p><p><code>scalesPageToFit</code> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b18fddadfeae5512690a0a059a4fa80c864f43a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commit</a>)</p><p>WKWebView didn&#x27;t support the scalesPageToFit prop, so we couldn&#x27;t implement this on the WebView React Native component.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_1YZR
