The Katonic Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of a Model. It provides model lineage (which Katonic experiment and run produced the model), model versioning, stage transitions (for example from staging to production), and annotations.","sidebar":"User Guide"},"pipeline-operations":{"id":"pipeline-operations","title":"Pipelines Operations","description":"Initiate kfp client","sidebar":"sdk"},"Pipelines":{"id":"Pipelines","title":"Pipelines","description":"Pipelines are components that orchestrates machine learning applications.
