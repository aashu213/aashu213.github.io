Changes made to these values are marshalled from step to step as inputs and outputs throughout a pipeline run.\nKatonic Automated Pipeline Deployment implements backends so that it can marshal objects that cannot be easily stringified. For example, Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment implements specialized backends for PyTorch and scikit-learn objects. Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment\u2019s marshalling backend framework is expandable to accommodate new object types as they are needed.")))}g.isMDXComponent=!0},12191:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment1-fcf418a7c44423b69b910886ac40aea5.png"},9510:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment10-472fde8a812157beb759d62518a75d25.png"},22240:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment11-d7e41f5a4a7856dfcfa094752fe194ba.png"},49528:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment12-26328c0ebaf3fc74b082a7ae0a6a0617.png"},97855:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment13-6bc3e068cf1650aff5c87bbc2c7ef368.png"},57972:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment14-aaa488ecdd0c249a03dfe27e9dda3c4a.png"},32667:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment15-05870d836f2337ec8f840769b1fd1e82.png"},51184:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment16-cd293be58205e979c2da07c5867b6401.png"},79453:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment17-d3a16f745666707ad002832a51629691.png"},94420:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment18-386634a2684453cda9429b7b1c5ea710.png"},5489:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment19-841f7870bfb3e80e08c9c6678f4e276d.png"},83521:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment2-bc8116533bcd4a0951cb6e3630eda2ae.png"},86215:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment3-561dd022be7680fd0062df74ceff05ea.png"},1416:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment4-7642461593a38d99e30d11e3182fde51.png"},312:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment5-d6f9492fdb8acbf73a6ca890abbc1428.png"},15021:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment6-afda5c0a32ae16d17089b9e628aac670.png"},88547:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment7-bde916a6e02a76c9456e18108b2a4032.png"},18943:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment8-4f11ca16698972a3cc221809edb487f0.png"},61742:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/PipelineDeployment9-9f2e9842f6ef7346e9cb65cd69b535dd.png"}}]);
